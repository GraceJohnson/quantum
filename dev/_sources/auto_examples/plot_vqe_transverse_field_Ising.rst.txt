Variational Quantum Eigensolver
-------------------------------

Variational Quantum Eigensolver ([1]_) (VQE) 
with Transverse Field Ising Model Hamiltonian using TensorLy-Quantum.
TensorLy-Quantum provides a Pythonic API to TT-tensor network circuit simulation
for large-scale simulation of variational quantum circuits,
with full Autograd support and an interface similar to PyTorch Neural Networks.
